This is all about 0x0B. C - malloc, free;

For this project, we expect you to look at this concept:
Automatic and dynamic allocation, malloc and free

General Objective;
1. What is the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation
2. What is malloc and free and how to use them
3. Why and when use malloc
4. How to use valgrind to check for memory leak

Tasks include the following;
1. Write a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.
2. Write a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.
3. Write a function that concatenates two strings.
4. Write a function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.
5. Write a function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your alloc_grid function.
6. Write a function that concatenates all the arguments of your program.
7. Write a function that splits a string into words.
