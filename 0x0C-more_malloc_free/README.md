For this project, we expect you to look at this concept:
Automatic and dynamic allocation, malloc and free

The General Objectives are;
1. How to use the "exit" function
2. What are the functions "calloc" and "realloc" from the standard library and how to use them

Our Tasks are as follows;
0. Write a function that allocates memory using malloc.
1. Write a function that concatenates two strings.
2. Write a function that allocates memory for an array, using malloc.
3. Write a function that creates an array of integers.
4. Write a function that reallocates a memory block using malloc and free
5. Write a program that multiplies two positive numbers.
